      <p>Syria has captured headlines for the last seven years with it’s intensive civil war, fought between the government and opposing forces. Opinionated articles flood Google, and yet, most don’t include articles attempting to solve the issues that plague innocent civilians caught in the cross fire.<br><br>Many times, these people who become collateral damage suffer from severe injuries caused by attacks in support to the war. These often include injuries, infections or diseases which require organ transplants, and yet, because Syria is a war zone, there is little opportunity to obtain such things. For example, it can be seen that almost 30% of children in Aleppo suffer from respiratory issues, with fluctuating numbers ailing from other problems. Three dimensional bioprinting is a relatively new technology, for sure. However, innovation has never developed so rapidly, and printing organs is quickly transforming from a fantasy into reality. This could help people in Syria, as having to wait for a transplant, or their body rejecting the transplant organ can often lead to the death of many people, even in highly developed countries. As can be expected, these issues are much worse in an area suffering as a combat zone such as Syria.<br><br>Three dimensional bioprinting would allow people to simply print compatible organs out, and would therefore allow for more efficient transplants. For example, Doctors Without Borders (also known as Médecins Sans Frontières) has already begun using three dimensional printing technology in order to print prosthetic limbs for victims of violence in Syria. In Jordan, the organisation partook in over two thousand major surgical interventions in just 2017, the majority of the patient demographic being Syrian refugees. It is important that we pay attention to the needs of innocent civilians and find ways to better aid them. According the the 3D Printing Media Network, “The pioneering technology is far cheaper and faster than conventional methods and could revolutionise the treatment of amputees around the world.” Clearly, this technology is already helping others in another form… If it could print live organs, it would be even more helpful.</p>
